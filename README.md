# RouteEstimator :airplane: 

## Description 
This program calculates the travel time for 5 modes of transport between any two major* cities on earth. It is CLI based and was a project for my Programming Fundamentals subject for CompSci.

There are two functions of the program:
- The route estimator lets the user input the cities manually and calculate the travel time between them.
  It also gives the option to plot a chart of the data.
- The file writer outputs travel time results to a csv file. 
  It has 10 preset origin and destination cities (go to line:297 to change values).

** How it works **


## TODO: 
- Create a GUI for the program for easier estimation.
